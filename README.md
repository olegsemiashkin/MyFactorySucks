# 🏭 MyFactorySucks 🤖

## 🧾 Description

Hey there! I'm a huge **Factorio** fan, and here I share my blueprints for the game. Don’t expect efficiency or brilliant designs — everything here will be as inefficient and chaotic as my factories. All I know how to do is create utter chaos and build factories that could never survive in real life. 😅

If you enjoy building absolutely pointless and weird contraptions — welcome! 😈💥

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. 📋 Copy the blueprint code.
2. 🎮 Import it into your **Factorio** game.
3. 😂 Enjoy the mess you've created, and laugh when your factory inevitably breaks down.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* 🧩 My blueprints may require mods or game versions that are no longer up-to-date — it depends on my mood.
* 🤝 If you have an idea for an improvement or want to add your own absurd creation, feel free to create a pull request!
