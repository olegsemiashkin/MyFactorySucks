# MyFactorySucks

## Description
Hey there! I'm a huge **Factorio** fan, and here I share my blueprints for the game. Don’t expect efficiency or brilliant designs — everything here will be as inefficient and chaotic as my factories. All I know how to do is create utter chaos and build factories that could never survive in real life.

If you enjoy building absolutely pointless and weird contraptions — welcome! :)

## How to Use
1. Copy the blueprint code.
2. Import it into your **Factorio** game.
3. Enjoy the mess you've created, and laugh when your factory inevitably breaks down.

## Important Notes
- My blueprints may require mods or game versions that are no longer up-to-date — it depends on my mood.
- If you have an idea for an improvement or want to add your own absurd creation, feel free to create a pull request!
