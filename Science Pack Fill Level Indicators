# 🔴🟢 Science Pack Fill Level Indicators

🔗 [View on FactorioPrints](https://factorioprints.com/view/-OPWkP2-Gj0os8IBcVBO)

## 🧠 Description

This blueprint implements a visual indicator system for container fill levels with science packs (red and green in this case). Lamps connected via the circuit network display the current fill level using a simple color scale:

- 🟢 **Green** — mostly empty  
- 🟡 **Yellow** — partially filled  
- 🔴 **Red** — almost full

This allows players to monitor science pack stock levels at a glance, without opening chests. It's especially useful in large factories with high research throughput.

## ⚙️ Features

- Thresholds configured through lamp conditions (circuit signals)
- Can be used with any type of science pack
- Easily scalable for larger storage areas
- Intuitive color coding for quick checks

## 📦 Components Used

- Lamps  
- Constant combinators  
- Red/green circuit wires  
- Chests (for science packs)

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Import the blueprint from the link above.  
2. Connect storage chests to the circuit network.  
3. Configure lamp conditions to match your fill-level preferences.  
4. Adjust filters for red or green science, or any other item.
